*Note: Does not include molecular dynamics of transcription*

Transcription is basically like [[DNA Replication]] so,

[[DNA]] -> [[RNA]]

Only difference being RNA does not include *Thymine* instead it has *Uracil*.

**DNA**
A-T
C-G
G-C
G-C
T-A
A-T
T-A

**DNA Split**

A-  T
C-  G
G-  C
G-  C
T-  A
A-  T
T-  A

**RNA**

**U**
G
C
C
A
**U**
A

Thus we are left with a single RNA strand.
