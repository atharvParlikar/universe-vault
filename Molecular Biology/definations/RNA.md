Ribonucleic acid is a genetic material with a structure similar to DNA but with just one strand.

## Anatomy

**Strands/backbone**: the strands are made up of Deoxyribose sugars and phosphate(acidic).

**Ladder / base pairs**: the ladder of DNA is made up of combination of 4 molecules that form 2 base pairs.

- Adenine
- Uracil
- Guanine
- Cytosine

## Base pairs

- Adenine == Uracil
- Guanine == Cytosine

these pairs are formed with [[Hydrogen bond]]

## Types of RNA

- **Messenger RNA(mRNA)**: Transcribed from [[DNA]], mRNA carries the genetic code for making proteins.
- **Transfer RNA(tRNA)**: Carries amino acids to ribosomes during protein synthesis.
- **Ribosomal RNA(rRNA)**: Forms the core of ribosomes, the structure where protein synthesis takes place.
