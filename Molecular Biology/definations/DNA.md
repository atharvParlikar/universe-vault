DNA stands for Deoxyribose-Nucleic-Acid.

## Anatomy

**Strands/backbone**: the strands are made up of Deoxyribose sugars and phosphate(acidic).

**Ladder / base pairs**: the ladder of DNA is made up of combination of 4 molecules that form 2 base pairs.

- Adenine
- Thymine
- Guanine
- Cytosine

**Pairs**:

- Adenine == Thymine
- Guanine == Cytosine

these pairs are formed with [[Hydrogen bond]], for further reading on these check [[Nucleobase classification]].

## Acidity

The acidity of DNA comes from the Phosphate present in the strands of DNA, and the base pairs are base but overall DNA is mildly acidic.
