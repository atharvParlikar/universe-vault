*Note: This page talks about DNA replication on a very high level and does not goes into the molecular mechanisms of it*

The idea is a single strand of DNA has just as much information as a whole DNA.

info(50% DNA) = info(100% DNA)
size(50% DNA) < size(100% DNA)

reason for this is simple, DNA is already 50% redundant as there are only 2 base pairs

- Adenine == Thymine
- Cytosine == Guanine

even if you take half of DNA away you can still rebuild it using only half the bases, as each can be paired with only 1 other base so there is no ambiguity.

Because of this nature of DNA, it can be replicated simply by ripping it in half and attaching matching bases.
The molecular mechanisms that make it happen are not clear to me and they will be studied later.

## Example

**Whole DNA**
A-T
C-G
G-C
G-C
T-A
A-T
T-A

**Half DNA**
A-  T
C-  G
G-  C
G-  C
T-  A
A-  T
T-  A

**Replication**
A-T   A-T
C-G   C-G
G-C   G-C
G-C   G-C
T-A   T-A
A-T   A-T
T-A   T-A
