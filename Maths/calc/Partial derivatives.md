Partial derivatives is the derivative of a multi variable function with respect to a parameter of that function.

Example

 $$f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$$
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$$

Above would be the partial derivative of the function f with respect to x.
In partial derivatives we simply treat the other parameters as constants.
Mechanically there is no difference in partial derivatives and derivatives (for function with single parameter / variable).
