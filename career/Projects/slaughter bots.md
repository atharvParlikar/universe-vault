## The AI/GPU problem.

Instead of fitting a small GPU on a tiny drone, have some GPU battery pack on the ground with decent electric supply and have some chip on the drone streaming data at high speeds.
this sounds way more doable, than creating custom small power efficient CNN chip.


## Data transmission

Do not send raw image frames, send edge data or some AI specific format. experiment with CNNs to get the best performing and smallest data format for fastest transmission.
