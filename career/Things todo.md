## From scratch

- [ ] Auth (otherwise you will always be that noob who can't cook up an auth)
- [ ] Interpreter / compiler (cuz everyone on twitter told me to)
- [ ] HTTPS protocol (cuz every normie implements HTTP)
- [x] Some RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol (using tcp ig)
- [x] Try out Go(lang) shit
- [ ] Redis from scratch
- [x] A WebRTC library in JS for React (hooks and shit)
- [ ] Voice smoothner in Rust / C
- [ ] AI agent on Android (use react-native)
- [ ] E2E encrypted communication (**Priority**)
- [x] tRPC style WebSocket library with zod + req-res model + native subscriptions without any hacks. [[zap-socket]]
- [ ] cracked and faster gRPC alternative.
- [ ] video editing language (based on ffmpeg).
- [ ] Modern SSH client with speculative rendering.

## Do after getting money

- [ ] Tiny ass drone ([[slaughter bots]])
- [ ] Auto self-landing rocket
- [ ] Self-driving car in GTA V / BeamNG (after getting a decent GPU)

### **🔥 1. High-Priority (Impactful + Fun)**

🚀 **E2E encrypted communication** (Top priority, privacy matters!)  
🛠 **Auth** (Get it done once, reuse it everywhere)  
🔍 **Physics Engine** (This is your passion, and it’s useful)

### **📌 2. Medium-Priority (Takes Effort but Worth It)**

🔄 **Redis from scratch** (Will teach **caching, storage, and distributed systems**)  
🔧 **tRPC WebSocket library** (If you use WebSockets a lot, this is sick)  
📡 **HTTPS protocol** (This will force you to understand TLS properly)

### **💡 3. Low-Priority (Interesting, but Maybe Later)**

🛠 **Interpreter/Compiler** (Cool but not urgent, unless you're going deep into PL theory)  
📜 **Peer.js docs site** (Helpful, but might not be a top priority)  
🎙 **Voice smoother in Rust/C** (Hard, but fun if you need real-time audio stuff)  
🛜 **RPC Protocol over TCP** (If you do WebRTC well, this becomes secondary)  
🤖 **AI Agent on Android** (More of an experimental side project)
