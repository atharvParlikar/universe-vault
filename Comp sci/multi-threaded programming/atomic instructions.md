**Atomic instructions** are special low-level operations provided by the CPU that ensure a sequence of steps is executed as a single, indivisible unit.

This means that when an atomic instruction is running, no other thread or process can interrupt it. Itâ€™s like temporarily pausing the rest of the system to ensure the operation completes without interference.

### Why Are Atomic Instructions Important?

When accessing or modifying shared resources, [[race conditions]] can occur if multiple threads execute non-atomic operations simultaneously. Mutexes, for example, rely on atomic instructions to lock or unlock safely. Without these, mutexes themselves could fall prey to race conditions.

### Example: Atomic vs. Non-Atomic Operations

#### Non-Atomic Increment (Prone to Race Conditions)

```assembly
load $t0, count  # Load count into a register
add  $t0, $t0, 1 # Increment
store $t0, count # Store the incremented value back
```

Here, another thread can modify `count` between the `load` and `store`, causing inconsistencies.

#### Atomic Increment (Safe)

```assembly
atomic_increment count  # Performs load, add, and store atomically
```

In this case, the operation is indivisible, so no other thread can access `count` during the update.

Atomic instructions form the backbone of synchronization mechanisms like [[mutex]] and are critical for building thread-safe programs.
